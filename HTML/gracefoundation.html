                <h2>Invest in Mental Health, Reap a Healthier Community</h2>
                <p>More than 700 000 people die due to suicide every year. For every suicide there are many more people who attempt suicide due to mental and emotional stress. Suicide is the fourth leading cause of death among 15-29 year olds. 13.6% of adults 18-25 had serious thoughts of suicide in the past year (SAMHSA, 2023). Effective and evidence-based interventions can be implemented at population, sub-population and individual levels to prevent suicide and suicide attempts. There are indications that for each adult who died by suicide there may have been more than 20 others attempting suicide</p>
                <p>Suicide is a global phenomenon; in fact, 77% of suicides occurred in low- and middle-income countries . Suicide accounted for 1.3% of all deaths worldwide, making it the 17th leading cause of death since 2019. We are dedicated in BHIF to caring for everyone with depression and mental health issues. Making sure all affected individuals are adequately taken care of and treated effectively.</p>
